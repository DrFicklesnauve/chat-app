# Chat App
## Created by: Joshua Kardell

This project includes usage of jQuery, NodeJS, Express, and Socket.io. The project is a simple chat app that gets input from the user and once submitted will add it to the DOM. The project exists on a Heroku repository where users can post things, and if in the same session, will allow other users to see what they've added. The Heroku link is found at: https://test-app-l.herokuapp.com/
